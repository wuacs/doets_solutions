For the first part consider:

$a_1 \mapsto b_1, a_2 \mapsto b_1$ 

$c_{a1} = c_{a1}$ is true in $A$ but not $c_{b1} = c_{b_2}$ in $B$ thus violating injection violates atomic formulas.

For the second part:


=>)

For it to be a isomorphism we need constants, $h(c^A_i)=c^B_i$.
Since there is a local isomorphism
