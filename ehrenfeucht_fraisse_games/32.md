So clearly $|A|=|B|=n$ otherwise:
- if $|B|<n$ let Di pick always elements in |A|, Sy will loose by empty model.
- if $|B| > n$ let Di pick always elements in |B|, Sy will loose inevitably by empty model.

Then, let $\sigma$ represent the choices of elements i.e. $\sigma \subseteq A \times B$, since $\sigma$ must be injective and the game has length n+1 all elements in A will be paired with a different element in B; i.e. we have a bijection.

Then we need to prove this bijection $\sigma: A \mapsto B$ is an isomorphism.

- $\sigma(c^A) = c^B$. Let $\lambda$ be an alias of $c^A$. Let $c_A$ be the constant introduced in the expanded language to represent the pair ($\lambda, \sigma(\lambda)$) then the sentence  $c^A_A = c^A$  is trivially true which by local isomorphism implies $c^B_A=c^B$ is true as well. I.e. $c^B_A=\sigma(\lambda)=c^B$ and $c^A_A=\lambda=c^A$.
 - For any relational symbol R $R^A(a_1,...,a_n) \iff R^A(c_1,...,c_n) \iff R^B(c_1, ..., c_n) \iff R^B(\sigma(a_1),...,\sigma(a_n))$
