**Lemma 3.12.2**
$m \ge 2^n-1 \implies Sy(\omega + \omega^+, \text{m}, n)$

**Proof**
We want to use the splitting lemma, to do it we work inductively.
For n = 0 it works by def.

For n+1, we need to prove that for any move of Di, Sy can always respond and eventually win.
- If Di picks any element in $\omega$ call it $i$:
	- if $i<2^n-1$ let Sy choose $j = i$ then of course $Sy(i\downarrow, j\downarrow, n)$ and $Sy(i\uparrow, j\uparrow, n)$ this last one comes from inductive hypothesis since $i\uparrow \cong \omega+\omega^*$ and $|j\uparrow|\ge 2^n-1$
	- If $i\ge 2^n-1$ let $j=2^n-1$ by lemma 3.12.1 we have $Sy(i\downarrow, j\downarrow, n)$ and for the other part use again the fact that $m \ge 2^{n+1}-1$ and $m - j \ge 2^{n+1}-1-2^n+1=2^{n}>2^n-1$ we can use the inductive hypothesis.
- If Di picks any element in $\omega^+$ reason as above but from right to left.
- If Di picks any element in $m$, say $j$ 
	- If $j<2^n-1$ then Sy picks $j$ in $\omega$ and it becomes $Sy(i \downarrow, j \downarrow, n)$ because i=j and $i\uparrow = \omega+\omega^*$ and it becomes $Sy(i\uparrow, j\uparrow, n)$ by inductive hypothesis since $|j\uparrow|>2^n-1$ 
	- If $j \ge 2^n-1$ then pick $j=i$, $Sy(j\uparrow, i\uparrow, n)$ is proved by lemma 3.12.1 and the other direction is obvious.
