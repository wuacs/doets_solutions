let's show $B \models \exists x\phi \implies \exists a \in A\; B \models \phi(a) \implies A \prec B$

---

Let us by cases on how $\phi$ might look like.

- $\phi$ **atomic formula**: this comes from the hypothesis $A \subset B$
- $\lnot$ **atomic formula**: this comes from inductive hypothesis
- $\exists x \psi$: $A \models \exists x \psi \iff \exists a \in A. A \models \psi[a] \iff \text{[ind. hypo.]} \iff \exists a \in A. B \models \psi[a] \iff \text{[lemma hypo.]} \iff B \models \exists x \psi$
- $\forall x \psi$: it is equivalent to $\lnot \exists x \lnot \psi$
- $\psi \land \xi$: inductive hypothesis.
- $\psi \lor \xi$: identical to above.
