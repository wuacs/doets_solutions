1. $A \prec B$ implies $\forall \alpha.\forall \phi. A \models \phi[\alpha] \iff B \models \phi[\alpha]$ so also sentence i.e. equivalence condition
2. By transitivity: $A \prec C$ implies that for any $\alpha$ A-assignment $A \models \phi[\alpha] \iff C \models \phi[\alpha]$ since $\alpha$ is also a $B$ assignment because $A \subset B$ and because $B \prec C$ we have $C \models \phi[\alpha] \iff B \models \phi[\alpha]$.
3. Consider $A=\mathbb{N}^+, <$ and $B = \mathbb{N}, <$. These are isomorphic. But $\phi(x) = x_1 < x_2 \land \exists y. y <x_1 \land x_2$ is not true in $A$ when $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2$ but it is in $B$.
