So each L-term is either a constant (max $|L|$ of them), or a variable (max $|\aleph_0|$ of them) or a function symbol with finite arity applied to other terms.
Thus you have $|L|+\aleph_0$ terms and then you have $|L|$ function symbols and each of them has a finite arity so say $i$. In each of this positions can go one of the $|L|+\aleph_0$ terms we just discovered so how many can we build? $i*(|L|+\aleph_0)=|L|+\aleph_0$ for any i natural.
You have also $|L|$ max function symbols thus you can build $|L| * (|L|+\aleph_0)$ which is $|L|^2=|L| + |L|*\aleph_0 = |L|+\aleph_0$ i.e. $|L|+|L|+\aleph_0$ i.e. $|L| + \aleph_0$
