One can solve this by proving that the theory behind structures like $(R, <)$ and $(Q, <)$ (i.e. DLO) admit *quantifier elimination*.

I.e. one can translate every formula in this language into a *logically equivalent* formula without quantifiers.

To do this, follow roughly these steps starting from a formula with quantifiers $L$.

 
1. Every atomic formula is just $x < y$ or $x = y$. We can rewrite equalities as **and** of $<$ symbol: $x = y \equiv \lnot x < y \land \lnot y < x$. So we can suppose we have only $x < y$ atomic formulas
2. If $\lnot \phi$ then we leave it as it is but conventionally we can interpret it as an atomic formula: $\lnot x < y$ is equivalent to $x \ge y$ in the usual understanding.
3. If $\phi \lor \psi$ and those are already in DNF just add them.
4. If $\psi \land \phi$ and those are already in DNF then suppose $\psi = (\psi_{1,1} \land \psi_{1,2} \land ...) \lor (\psi_{2,1},...) ...$ and $\phi = (\phi_{2,1} \land \phi_{2,2} \land \phi_{2,3} ...) \lor (\phi_{2,1}, \lor \phi_{2,2} \lor ...)$ then doing AND means any of those combinations need just to be true i.e. $(\psi_{1,1} \land \psi_{1,2} \land ... \land \phi_{2,1} \land \phi_{2,2}...) \lor (\psi_{2,1} \land \psi_{2,2} \land ... \phi_{2,1} \land \phi_{2,2}..) \lor...$ 
5. If $\exists x \phi$ and $\phi$ is in DNF then just remove the existential by looking at each factor constraints on $x$ and replacing it with those constraints.
6. If $\forall x\phi$ transform it in $\lnot \exists x \lnot \phi$
At the end you will have a DNF of atomic formulas or negation of them.
