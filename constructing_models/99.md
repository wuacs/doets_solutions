We need to verify two claims:

# Claim 1: $t^A=|t|$
By cases:

1. If $t=c$ for some constant $c$ then by definition $c^A=\{x|x=c \in \Gamma\}=|c|$
2. If $t=f(t_{1},\dots,t_{n})$ for some function symbol $f$, by induction $t^A_{i}=|t_{i}|$ so $f^A(t_{1},\dots,t_{n})=f^A(|t_{1}|,\dots,|t_{n}|)$. By definition of the function symbols in $A$: $f^A(|t_{1}|,\dots,|t_{n}|)=|f^A(t_{1},\dots,t_{n})|$.
# Claim 2:
## Existential case
If $\phi = \exists x\psi(x)$, then by the **Henkin property** there exists a constant $c_\psi$ such that $\psi(c_\psi) \in \Gamma$.  
By the induction hypothesis, $A \models \psi(c_\psi)$, and thus choosing the witness $c_\psi^A=|c_{\psi}|$ we have $A \models \exists x.\psi(x)$.
## Negation

If $\phi = \lnot \psi$, then
$$
A \models \phi \iff A \not \models \psi
$$Since $\Gamma$ is maximal and finitely satisfiable by Lemma 4.3.3, we have $$\lnot \psi \in \Gamma \iff \psi \notin \Gamma$$
Since $\psi$ has one less logical symbol we can apply inductive hypothesis, and obtain $$A \models \phi \iff A \not \models \psi \underbrace\iff_{induction} \psi \not \in \Gamma \iff \lnot \psi \in \Gamma$$

### **Conjunction**

If $\phi = \psi \land \xi$, then by Lemma 4.3.2

$\psi \land \xi \in \Gamma \iff (\psi \in \Gamma \ \text{and}\ \xi \in \Gamma)$.

By Tarskiâ€™s definition of truth,

$A \models \psi \land \xi \iff (A \models \psi\ \text{and}\ A \models \xi)$,

and by the induction hypothesis both conjuncts on the right are satisfied. Hence $A \models \psi \land \xi$.

### **Atomic formulas**

1. If $\phi = t_1 = t_2$, then by definition of [[#Claim 1 $t A= t $]]:
    
    $t_1^A = |t_1|, \qquad t_2^A = |t_2|$.
    
    Therefore, $A \models t_1 = t_2$ iff $(t_1 = t_2) \in \Gamma$.
    
2. If $\phi = r(t_1, \dots, t_n)$, recall that $t_i^A = |t_i|$, so
    
    $A \models r(t_1, \dots, t_n) \iff A \models r(|t_1|, \dots, |t_n|) \iff r(t_1, \dots, t_n) \in \Gamma$.
