In practice we need to prove that for any variable free term $t$ there exists a constant $c$ such that $c \sim t$ or equivalently $c = t \in \Gamma$

Consider the formula $\phi := \exists x. x = t$:

1. By maximality $\phi \in \Gamma$ as, take any subset subset $\Delta \subset \Gamma$ then any model of $\Gamma$ is also model of $\Delta$ and $t$ is interpreted to some element. Just pick this element for the witness.
2. By Henkin Property we introduce a constant $c$ such that $c = t \in \Gamma$.
3. This can be done for any term $t$ proving that there exists a constant such that $|c|=|t|$
