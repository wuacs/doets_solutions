We need to show that if $\Sigma$ is finitely satisfiable the set $\Sigma'=\Sigma \cup \{\phi (c) | \exists x.\phi \in \Sigma\}$ is again finitely satisfiable.

So pick any subset $\Delta \subset \Sigma'$. If $\Delta \subseteq \Sigma$ then we conclude by hypothesis.
Otherwise $\Delta = \alpha \cup \beta$ where $\beta \cap \Sigma=\emptyset$, i.e. $\beta \subseteq \{\phi (c) | \exists x.\phi \in \Sigma\}$.

For any $\phi(c) \in \beta$ a formula $\exists x. \phi$ is in $\Sigma$, so take the finite subset 
$\alpha \cup \{ \exists x.\phi| \phi(c) \in \beta \} \subseteq \Sigma$. 
By hypothesis, it holds that this subset has a model. Call it $A$.
But since $A \models \exists x \phi$ if we interpret $c$ as the witness we have $A \models \phi(c)$. Thus, $A \models \beta$.
