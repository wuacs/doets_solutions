# Step 0: Fixing a new Language
Fix a language
$$
L' = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty} L_i
$$
where
$$
\begin{aligned}
L_0 &= L,\\
L_{i+1} &= L_i \cup \{\, c_\varphi \mid \exists x\,\varphi(x)\ 
   \text{is a formula of } L_i \,\}.
\end{aligned}
$$

# Step 1: Henkinzation over $L'$
With $L'$ fixed, consider the poset of all $L'$-theories ordered by inclusion.
We construct an increasing chain
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Sigma_0 &= \Sigma,\\
\Sigma_{i+1} &= \Sigma_i \cup 
   \{\, \varphi(c_\varphi)\mid \exists x\,\varphi(x)\in \Sigma_i \,\}.
\end{aligned}
$$
Let
$$
\Sigma_H = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty}\Sigma_i.
$$
Then $\Sigma_H$ satisfies:
## Henkin property
If $\exists x\,\varphi(x)\in \Sigma_H$, then 
$\exists x\,\varphi(x)\in \Sigma_i$ for some finite $i$, since it uses 
only finitely many symbols of $L'$. 
If $\Sigma_H$ lacked the Henkin property, we would have added 
$\varphi(c_\varphi)$ at the next stage $\Sigma_{i+1}$, a contradiction. 
Hence $\Sigma_H$ is Henkin.
## Finite Satisfiability
Since $\Sigma$ was finitely satisfiable, adding Henkin axioms preserves
finite satisfiability. 
Indeed, take any finite subset $\Delta\subseteq \Sigma_i$. 
Suppose we added a formula $\varphi(c_\varphi)$; this occurs only if  $\exists x\,\varphi(x)\in \Sigma_i$. 
Consider the finite subtheory $\Delta\cup\{\exists x\,\varphi(x)\}$, which has a model $A$.
Interpret $c_\varphi$ in $A$ as a witness for $\varphi$, so that $A\models \varphi(c_\varphi)$. 
Since $c_\varphi$ occurs nowhere else, its interpretation is arbitrary,
and the extended theory remains finitely satisfiable.
# Step 2: Maximization
With $L'$ fixed, consider again the poset of all finitely satisfiable 
$L'$-theories that also satisfy the Henkin property, ordered by inclusion.
Take a chain $(\Delta_i)_{i<\omega}$ starting from the Henkin theory
$\Sigma_H = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty}\Sigma_i$ constructed in Step~1. 
Every chain has an upper bound 
$M = \bigcup_i \Delta_i$, which is finitely satisfiable and Henkin:
if $\exists x\,\varphi(x)\in M$, then it belongs to some $\Delta_i$
and thus $\varphi(c_\varphi)\in \Delta_i\subseteq M$.

By Zorn's Lemma there exists a maximal element $\Sigma'$ in this poset.
Hence $\Sigma'$ is a finitely satisfiable and Henkin $L'$-theory that is 
maximal with respect to inclusion, as required.
