So by version 2 of the compactness theorem, a finite subset $\Delta$ of $\Gamma$ exists such that $\Delta \models \phi$.
So we wish to prove that $\phi \models \Delta$ i.e. that $\phi \land \lnot \Delta$ is unsatisfiable.
So $\Delta=\psi_{1}\land \psi_{2}\land\dots \psi_{n}$
this is equal to saying that there is no model where $\phi$ and any $\phi_{i}$ does not hold.
Suppose it is not, so there is a model of $\phi$ where $\lnot \psi_{i}$ is satisfied. But $\psi_{i} \in \Gamma$ and this model is also a model of $\Gamma$ by assumption, contradiction.
