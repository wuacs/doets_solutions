Note: this exercise seems trivial, but the main point is that models of $\phi$ do not need to satisfy the *same* sentence of $\Sigma$.

Consider the set of all sentences that the models of $\phi$ satisfy by assumption: $\Xi$. So take $\overline{\Xi}=\{\lnot \sigma | \sigma \in \Xi\}$. 

$\phi \cup \overline{\Xi}$ is not satisfiable: pick a model of $\phi$, by assumption it satisfies $\sigma \in \Xi$, so it cannot satisfy $\lnot \sigma \in \overline{\Xi}$.

By compactness theorem, if all finite subsets of $\phi \cup \overline{\Xi}$ were satisfiable then also $\phi \cup \overline{\Xi}$ would have been.

So there must exist a subset $\xi \subset \phi \cup \overline{\Xi}$ unsatisfiable.

So, 
1. if $\phi \not\in \xi$ we have $\bigwedge_{i=1}^k(\lnot \sigma_{i})\not\models$ which is as saying $\models \bigvee_{i=1}^k\sigma$ i.e. it is always the case that at least one formula in $\Xi$ is true.
2. if $\phi \in \xi$ we have $\{\phi\} \cup \{\bigwedge_{i=1}^k(\lnot \sigma_{i})\}\not\models$, since $\phi$ is satisfiable, it is equivalent to say $\{\phi\} \models \bigvee_{i=1}^k\sigma$. Thus every model in $\phi$ satisfies a sentence in $\Xi$.
