Any model of $\Sigma$ is a model of any of its subsets.

So, for the other direction

Now take $\phi:= \lnot \Gamma$: $\Sigma \models \lnot \Gamma$ otherwise a model of $\Sigma$ would be a model of $\Gamma$.

Now by compactness version 2 there exists a finite subset of $\Sigma$ such that $\Delta \models \lnot \Gamma$.

So any model of $\Delta$ must be a model of $\Sigma$ by assumption.
