This repository contains solutions to an incomplete subset of the ones proposed by Doets in 
[basic model theory](https://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/Online/doets-basic-model-theory.pdf) divided by chapter.

There may be errors as these are my personal solutions and I am still a beginner in Model Theory, so feel free
to open PRs when you want to add new solutions or notify an error in an existing one! ðŸ˜Š
